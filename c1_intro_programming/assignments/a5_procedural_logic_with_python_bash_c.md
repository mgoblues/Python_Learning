## Exercises


## Assignment

### Technical Greetings

Join the ranks of polyglot programmers, and create programs in C, Python, and
Bash that print the canonical first phrase 'Hello World' to standard output.

Use the `gcc` program to compile C source down to an executable:

    gcc -o hello hello.c
    ./hello

### Temperature Conversion 

Write a function that converts Fahrenheit to Cengtigrade, and another
function that computes the inverse operation.

### Parsing Data

Write a python function to parse a comma separated list of values and return the
element specified by an index argument. Combine this with a function to read
each line of a file and process them so that you can extract the values from a
CSV file.

### Encapsulating Functionality

Pick 3 challenges from earlier assignments and modify the code so the
calculations are performed within the body of a function that accepts parameters
defining specifics of the operation, for instance writing a function that writes
the argument string to a file.
